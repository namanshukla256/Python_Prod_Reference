# Simplicity: KISS, DRY, YAGNI

## Principles

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until needed

These principles help avoid over-engineering.

## Bad Example (bad_string_utils.py)
- Over-engineered solutions
- Repeated code
- Unnecessary features
- Complex abstractions for simple tasks

## Good Example (good_string_utils.py)
- Simple, straightforward code
- Reusable functions
- Only needed features
- Easy to understand

## Quick Demo
```bash
python bad_string_utils.py
python good_string_utils.py
```
